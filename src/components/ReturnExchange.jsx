          As we do not have our own delivery service we rely on delivery
          partners like BlueDart, Delhivery, DTDC, etc In case of an exchange;
          the delivery partner charges us for reverse pickup from the customer
          location and then additional delivery charges for delivering new
          product again to the customer location, As these charges are two-way;
          we request our customers to pay for one way charge i.e â‚¹100
